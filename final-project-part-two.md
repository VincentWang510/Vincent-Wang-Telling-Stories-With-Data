# User research 

## Target audience
The target audience for my topic would preferably be the public because I would want to influence someone on the fence about their view on crime to do further research on crime. The factors influencing crime policy are the voters themselves. I will compile evidence to create a narrative that persuades my audience that maybe the issue of crime is not as overblown as the media tries to portrait it to be. Also, I want my audience to know that the government is trying their best to alleviate the issue of crime, but sometimes crafting good policies is hard and we cannot predict the results. Ultimately, I wanted my final draft to be accessible to all audiences while still maintaining an overall professional tone and jargon.


## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|To gauge if the visualizations provided insight into the story being told      |1.) What story do you think the data is telling you?          |
|Understand if the story unfolds in a way that’s easy to follow and understand  |2.) Is the overall structure and flow of the story clear?     |
|Evaluate the effectiveness of different design choices I made for my graphs didn’t? (i.e. titles, use of white space, color choice, etc.)      |3.) Please provide specific feedback on the visualizations. What worked? What                |
|Check if there are any missing story elements or specific areas I should elaborate on      |4.) Are there any story elements you feel are missing or could help tell a more compelling story? (i.e. more graphs on geography, more context on a specific topic)                  |
|Check if the story is compelling, appropriate, and persuasive for the target audience      |5.) Who do you think the target audience is?                  |
|Understand if the main takeaways and recommendations are clear      |6.) Is the call to action clear?                  |


## Interview findings
My target audeince is the general voting population thus I wanted to focus on Gen-Z voters as they are the people least likely to vote (VERY SAD). I wanted to interivew non-policy students because non-policy students are more likely to be less informed about the topic I present in the project. I think the questions I asked were general and specific enough to gauge if the story was clear for the general public as well as my target audience. 

*Person 1: Man, Age 27, Accountant
*Person 2: Woman, Age 26, Chemical Engineer
*Person 3: Woman, Age 26, Electrical Engineer

| Questions               | Person 1  | Person 2 | Person 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Question 1                        | Certain crimes are on the decline despite public sentiment feeling otherwise.         |The data is saying that crime rates haven’t been increasing in the same rate as the fear of crime has.              |Since 1990 crime has been on a downward trend (all types), but public perception towards crime has not reflected that trend. Public view does not correlate with real data on number of crimes committed. As a result, the increased fear towards crime pushed California to pass prop 47 in 2014 to help shift focus towards tackling violent crime (in particular). But it does not seem like Prop 47 worked, since violent crimes seem to be trending upwards instead.              |
| Question 2                        |Somewhat                                |Yes but the claim has to be clear in the beginning.              |It's mostly clear. There are a few places that need to be swapped and some things (like examples) to be added. There should be a clearer distinction between the federal data and then the response at the state level (in your case, California). You also need to discuss prop 47 more. The reasoning should go first, and then the expected benefits from it - with focus on decreasing violent crimes. Then you should discuss the actual benefits coming from prop 47 (like the financial part you have), and then finally highlight that it FAILED to decrease violent crime. Could it be possible that California was trying to fix a problem that wasn't as serious? If so, did prop 47 create more problems than solve and is that now your call to action?             |
| Question 3                        |Graphs were a great way to display the data-driven argument. However, it would be best to size them all uniformly.                                |Paragraphs were short enough to digest and visuals were good additions.              |Some of the fonts and sizes of the axes need to be increased. There also needs to be fixed lines in the data that focuses on key years (like when prop 47 was passed, and the crime spike in 1990, etc). Before and after prop 47 should be on the same graph ideally, but they can be directly next to each other with emphasis that prop 47 failed.              |
| Question 4                        |As a reader, I wanted more context over the ramifications of each proposition. For example, when theft occurred under the dollar amount, was it not considered a crime and not part of the data plot as a result? Or was it reportable but not punishable as an offense?                                |Would like to see more on data regarding fear mongering and the role media has in influencing the general mass. Maybe an addition of social media and internet usage from the same time frame.              |The data on the crimes committed need to be normalized to the population (it won't change too much, but it will be send a clearer message). There also needs to be examples of the types of crimes you are plotting because I don't know what classifies as what. You also briefly mentioned social media and how it 'seems' like crime has been getting worse from a non-informed resident like myself. You should find some data on increased use of social media apps (there should be an upward trend even higher after COVID-19), and then if you plot that with the trend in larceny crimes and perception towards crime, the larceny crime 'remaining constant' will hopefully be more of a message.             |
| Question 5                        |The American public                                |The general public in understanding the actual crime rate data              |The general public with intent to inform, since it seems like there is no clear call to action yet.             |
| Question 6                        |Yes, it is to deliver information without biases.                                |Not yet              |No             |
| Please provide me any additional feedback if you think I missed something!                        |Inherently removing biases from media outlets and algorithms is extremely difficult from a bystander’s perspective because each medium is controlled by politically invested individuals or entities. So if there’s a route you’d like to suggest in the call to action to make this action plan more substantive and graspable that would be ideal.                                |Looks good so far             |I think you'll need to be very clear with the call to action at the top of the deck. Are you trying to say the call to action is the need to focus on reducing crime as a whole? Or are you trying to say the call to action is with increased fear mongering (discussed with data from social media usage, since unfortunately that is where false news come from), there is a correlation with crime?              |

# Identified changes for Part III
Key changes:
* I need to be better at creating a transition from the Federal Data to the California Data
* Most of the visualizations were easy to understand and supported my key findings, but there need to be better design in the Prop 47 graphs. Person 3 also stated that she would me to combine the prop 47 visuals into a side by side visual.
* The formatting on Shorthand is weird, need to work on it.
* The call to action needs to be improved.
* The amount of data is good. 


| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Redesign Elements | For the prop 47 visual, I will google and learn how to better use tableau to create a dashboard that has a side by side visual. I was having a lot of trouble with Tableau as the two graphs used two different datasets. I may combine the datasets into a single data set. |
| Call to Action | My call to action was unclear to two of my users. They advised that it could be more direct and specific. Since I only listed preliminary ideas and policy interventions for my call to action I will add more details and resource links in my final submission. Ultimately, I want my call to action to convince my audience to care and stay informed.                                                                                |
| Create Better Transitions | I need to include a slide that transtions the American perspective into the California focus section. Maybe I will ask a question in that slide. This question could be "Do you personally believe that crime is down" |
| Normalizing the Data With the Population | Person 3 stated that data on the crimes committed need to be normalized to the population to send a clearer message. I agree with this take as it would give a more truthful visual that is based on the ebb and flow of the population in California. I will acquire the data and make changes. |
| Defining What Violent Crimes and Larceny-Theft | In the slide after introducing the topic, I will define each terms as it will help my audience understand the distinctions of each group and what crimes that are part of the categories |
| Being more consistent with the visuals | Looking at the rough draft of my story, I do not like some of the visuals as the designs are not constistent. Some of the graphs were made with datawrapper and some with Tableau. I will improve on keeping consistent font usage and title names. 

### Final Thoughts
This project has been tough! Tabeau has not been very easy to use honestly. Getting the proper data has also been a challenge. Narrowing down the project has also been tough. Shorthand is hard to work with in terms of design. I want to add an additonal column to certain layouts but have been unsucessful.
