# Outline
#### Project Summary 
According to Forbes, the crime rate in the United States has dramatically fell since 1993, however, American perspective on crime rates within the United states show a trend of misunderstanding where they beleive that crime is worsening nationally. 

The issue of crime has long been a tumultuous topic in American politics. Each political party proposes its own solutions for addressing it, but given how extensively it has been debated over the years, one might question whether it remains as significant a problem as often portrayed.

In California, in the most recent election, 2/3 of Californians voted to approve of Proposition 36. Prop 36 allows felony charges for possessing certain drugs and for thefts under $950, if defendant has two prior drug or theft convictions. (https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/36/) The overwhelming support is a total reversal of the support that Propostion 47 recieved in 2014. Sixty percent of Californians voted for Prop 47 that year, a transformative initiative that reduced certain drug possession and theft crimes from felonies into misdemeanors. (https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2024/10/17/prop-36/) One can assume that California's perspective on crime completely reversed in 10 years. 

In this project, I seek to evaluate crime within California and try to tell a story on why crime rates have risen over the last 10 years. I will start this story by highlighting the crime rate trends in California and constrast it with the United State's average. I will create seperate graphs that aggregate the different types into 2 categories: Property Crime and Violent Crimes. I will be defining these before the diagrams with an explanation. The purpose of this first part is to give evidence that although the U.S average maybe have decreased, the crime rate in California seems to have increased over time. 

or the second part of my story, I wanted to delve into the why and the reasons this issue is opposite of the national trend. This involved researching topics on the trend of rent prices, cost of living, unemployment, poverty, population growth, and COVID-19. Using these different topic, I hope to create a narrative that maybe, being tougher on crime may not be the only solution as we need to view this problem from a economic, sociology and humanitarian lense. I will seek to introduce this section by showing a graphic displaying California's share of the U.S's GDP and try to create a narrative that even though California is "rich," the people are not "rich." My goal is to educate those who misunderstand the issue of crime and propose possible policy and community-based interventions. 

#### Story Structure:
1. Set Up: Reports are showing that the average crime rate inthe United States has significantly decreased since the 1990s, but this may not be the case for California. 
* Introduce the topic: Crime Trends in California.
* Talk about the repeal of Prop 47 in 2014 (show spike in crime), then talk about Prop 36 passing in recent election. Set the stage for showing that Californians are tried of crime and want to tackle it. 
* Provide context: statistics on each crime for California
* Compare it with the United State's average.

2. Conflict: Although California holds one of the highest shares of the U.S's GDP, why is this crime rate so high? Crime has deeper roots and should not be looked at as a black and white problem. Solving it requires multifaceted solutions.
* Data on unemployment
* Data on rent prices
* Data on population growth (I'm trying to use this data to say that the population is not growing but the crime rate is growing. This means that people are committing more crimes)
* Data on poverty

3. Resolution: Understanding and improving this problem requires educated decision-makers to consider how policy interventions and systemic changes need to take into account other factors that can alleviate the crime issue in CA.
* Why the audience should care?
* Call to action
  * Get people out to vote!
  * Build more afforable housing
  * Improve cost of living
* Conclusion/Summarize

# Method and medium
I have leaned towards using Shorthand to create a interactive and visually appealing narrative story. I will also use Tableau to create different types of interactive visualizations to include in my final shorthand presentation.
